🧠 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Website name

NoteSnap

What the site is about

A product landing page for a fictional service that:

turns messy notes into clean, structured summaries.

The goal of the site is not functionality, but:

strong UI/UX

scroll-triggered animations

storytelling through text + motion

portfolio-quality design

🧱 SITE STRUCTURE (SECTIONS)

We agreed on a clean, limited number of sections:

Hero section

Combined Problem + Solution section

Features / Benefits section

How It Works section

Call To Action (CTA)

Footer

1️⃣ HERO SECTION
Purpose

Introduce NoteSnap immediately

Set visual style

Introduce the character (robot)

Layout

Left side: text

Right side: robot character + messy notes visuals

Content (text)

Headline (big, animated):

“Your messy notes. Cleaned instantly.”

Subheadline:

“Snap, organize, and share — smarter notes, faster.”

CTA button:

“Try NoteSnap”

Animations

Headline fades/slides in on load

Subheadline appears slightly after (staggered)

CTA button hover animation (scale / shadow)

Robot:

subtle floating (up/down)

head tilt

Messy notes:

slow floating motion

random placement (represents chaos)

2️⃣ COMBINED PROBLEM + SOLUTION SECTION (CORE SECTION)

This is the main creative section of the site.

Purpose

Show problems AND solutions together

Tell a story with scroll

Sync text (left) with visual animation (right)

Layout

Left 50%: text

Right 50%: animated visuals (notes + robot)

Left Side (Text)

The text appears step by step as you scroll.

Each problem is followed by its solution.

Example structure:

Problem 1:

“Too many scribbles. Notes get lost.”

Solution 1:

“NoteSnap organizes everything instantly.”

Problem 2:

“Important details buried in chaos.”

Solution 2:

“Find what matters at a glance.”

Problem 3:

“Sharing notes is slow and messy.”

Solution 3:

“One click to share clean notes.”

Text animations

Each line:

fades in

slides slightly from bottom or side

Problems and solutions are separate scroll moments

Right Side (Visual Representation)

This side reacts to the text.

Visual concept

Notes are DOM or SVG elements

At first:

scattered

rotated

messy

When solution text appears:

notes align

stack

snap into order

Robot role (illusion-based interaction)

Robot does NOT physically grab notes

Robot:

looks at notes

tilts head

moves arm slightly

Notes animate in sync → illusion of interaction
